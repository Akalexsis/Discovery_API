Time spent: **8-10** hours spent in total

## Required Features

- [ ] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [x] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [x] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [ ] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
  - [ ] To ensure an accurate grade, your recording **must** show that when clicked, an attribute in the ban list is immediately removed from the list of banned attributes
- [ ] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- I had no idea how to find an API endpoint
  - In class, we discussed how to use an API, but not how to find it and how to read documentation for it, so I had to learn this
  before I could use it in my project
- Did not know how to work Spotify API
    - Needed to use a post to gain access to spotify WEB API but I donâ€™t know how to write a post command yet
    - Research on YouTube and asked ChatGPT how to convert a curl request (shown in the Spotify documentation) into a fetch requst
     (a request I know how to make)
- Difficulties getting only one API request to show at a time
  - I knew useEffect would solve this issue, but I was unsure how to use it within an onClick function
